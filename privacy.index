      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the application (“the App”) uses the device camera strictly for scanning QR codes when the user chooses to add a new device.</p>

      <h2>Camera Permission and Usage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App may request access to the device <strong>camera</strong> solely to enable <strong>QR code scanning</strong> during the “Add device” flow.</li>
        <li>Using the camera is <strong>optional</strong>. If you prefer not to grant camera permission, you can add devices manually.</li>
        <li>No photos or videos are taken or stored. The camera stream is used <strong>only for parsing the QR code</strong>.</li>
        <li>No images are uploaded or transmitted to any server or third party. QR code parsing is performed locally for the purpose of extracting the code content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Collection and Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App does not collect or share photographs, video, or biometric data.</li>
        <li>Any configuration data derived from a QR code is used only to complete the device‑addition process within the App.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>User Choice and Control</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can deny or revoke camera permission at any time in your device settings. The manual device‑entry option remains available without camera access.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>The App uses the camera strictly as described above. No image content is stored or transmitted.</p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed to children under the age applicable in your jurisdiction. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

      <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.</p>
